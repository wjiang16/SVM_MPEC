# SVM_MPEC
This project solves the hyper-parameter optimization for Support Vector Machine (SVM) as a Mathematical Programming with Equilibrium Constraint (MPEC) problem.  GAMS was used as the optimization solver. 

This code uses GAMS as the optimization solver. Therefore, to run this code, you need setup GAMS python API. 
In addition, you need to install following python packages: numpy, sklearn, matplotlib.
